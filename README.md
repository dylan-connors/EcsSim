EcsSim for COMP1202 coursework

Can be run by compiling normally in terminal. Base submission runs as specified in the coursework description (e.i. java EcsSim 'staff file' 'budget' 'years').

All parts of base specification attempted.

Extension: 
  Implemented a save system. Once a simulation has completed  the specified amount of years, the user is asked if they wish to 'Save & Quit' or 'Quite'. 
  If they chose to save, then a save file is generated which allows the simulation to be restored, and continued from the year it left off at, restoring
  buildings, employed staff, the budget, and the state of the staff market. The save is loaded by supplying java EcsSim with the name of the save file,
  and the years you wish to further simulate as arguments (e.g. java EcsSim save1.txt 10).
